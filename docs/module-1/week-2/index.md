# Week 2: Docker, Docker Compose, and DevContainers

Session 1: Docker Fundamentals 🐳
This session introduces Docker, explaining the difference between containers and virtual machines. Students will write their first Dockerfile to containerize a simple Python application.

Session 2: Orchestration & Reproducible Environments ⚙️
Building on the first session, we'll introduce Docker Compose to manage multi-service applications (e.g., a web app and a database). The session will culminate in setting up DevContainers for our course, ensuring every student has an identical, reproducible development environment from this point on.

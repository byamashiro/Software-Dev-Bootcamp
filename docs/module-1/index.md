# Module 1: Foundational Tools & Environment

This module is designed to get students set up with the essential tools for collaborative and reproducible software development. They will master Git and GitHub, learn to use Visual Studio Code, and then dive into the world of containers with Docker, Docker Compose, and DevContainers.

## Git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code

[Session 1: Git & GitHub Essentials üíª](./session-1.md)
This session covers the fundamentals of version control. Students will learn core Git commands like init, add, commit, and status. We'll also cover the collaborative aspects of GitHub, including push, pull, and the concept of a pull request.

[Session 2: Visual Studio Code Mastery ‚úçÔ∏è](./session-2.md)
Students will be introduced to Visual Studio Code (VS Code), our primary development environment for the bootcamp. We'll explore its user interface, essential shortcuts, and key extensions. The goal is for students to become comfortable and efficient with the editor.

## Docker, Docker Compose, and DevContainers

[Session 3: Docker Fundamentals üê≥](./session-3.md)
This session introduces Docker, explaining the difference between containers and virtual machines. Students will write their first Dockerfile to containerize a simple Python application.

[Session 4: Orchestration & Reproducible Environments ‚öôÔ∏è](./session-4.md)
Building on the first session, we'll introduce Docker Compose to manage multi-service applications (e.g., a web app and a database). The session will culminate in setting up DevContainers for our course, ensuring every student has an identical, reproducible development environment from this point on.

# Welcome to Bootcamp

This site contains the materials for Ka ªimi's (_very_) opinionated software developer bootcamp. This bootcamp will cover a large variety of concepts neccessary to succeed as a data/analytics-oriented software developer. 


## Structure of the bootcamp:

- Related content has been grouped into modules.
    - Each module spans at least one week (some are longer/shorter than others).
        - Each week will have two sessions, each discussing a primary concept.
            - Each session will be followed by recommended "homework" to apply the concepts discussed.
            - Furthermore, recommended additional materials will be made available.
